EDA helps us in understanding our data more clearly and making better decisions. It is a process of critically analysing the data so as to discover various patterns, anomalies, assumptions, etc. One uses various graphical and statistical methods to perform EDA. Graphics helps to visualse the data and quick detection and understanding of any pattern or anomaly. It also shows what is there in the data and how it is placed in given dataset. It is the first step towards analysis.
